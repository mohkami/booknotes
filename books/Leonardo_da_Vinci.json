It got sold for $21,850 in the auction. But Peter Silvarman tries to prove others that this was actually a Leonardo's painting. Around 2009 in was almost got proved that this was his painting and now it was worth $150 million.\r\nThe subject of the painting is Bianca Sforza. A duke's illegitimate (and later legitimate) daughter. In 1496, when she was about 13, she was married  to one of the most important members of the court: Galeazzo Sanseverino.

And it shows how he thought it's the most important part of painting. \"The primary goal of a painter is to make a flat surface display a body as if modeled and separated from this plane\". Then he goes on to talk about how a line is an imaginary idea than a real object. \"Between light and darkness there's infinite variation, because their quantity is continuous.\" These ideas and his insistence that all boundaries are blurred led him to become the pioneer of sfumato.\r\n\r\nAn experiment done in 11th century by an Arab mathematician Alhazen, that used a needle. If you use a needle and bring it closer to your eye, it will eventually become a blur, proving that you the rays of light is not converged at a single point inside the eye but is diffused throughout the retina of the eye.\r\n\r\nHe also dissected a skull and cut an eye for his experiment. To be able to cut an eye in half, he boils the eye in an egg white first."},{"Id":9,"Order":7,"Header":"1490","Caption":"La Belle Ferronniere","ImageUrl":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Leonardo_da_Vinci_%28attrib%29-_la_Belle_Ferroniere.jpg/542px-Leonardo_da_Vinci_%28attrib%29-_la_Belle_Ferroniere.jpg","Body":"This shows how at times artists have to subdue their geniuses to the needs of their clients.\r\n\r\nThe subject is Lucrezia Crivelli, who succeeded Cecilia as Ludovico's maitresse-en-titre (official mistress). It's hard to accept this work to be by Leonardo as there are so many things that are questionable about it that makes this painting to not be in his league. Kenneth Clark would say \"I am now inclined to think that the picture is by Leonardo, and shows how in these years he was willing to subdue his genius to the needs of the court\".\r\n"},{"Id":10,"Order":6,"Header":"1489","Caption":"Lady with an Ermine","ImageUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/h_LbKn2W0q3Gl3QZejfsvcSYWBCfx2pIFw13Lo4XCR4jr3CjNYzP8XYqq8PeImG8eSitslJxA6e83sqgl4Xi6r4rEUA_","Body":"In 1483, when she was ten, her brothers were able to arrange a promising marriage contract for her to Giovanni Stefano Visconti, a member of the family that once ruled Milan. But four years later the contract was dissolved. In 1489, Ludovico Sforza was attracted to her and she lived in rooms provided by Ludovico and the year after, she was pregnant with his son. But the biggest problem with their relationship was that Ludovico had been contracted to marry Beatrice d'Este, the daughter of Ercole d'Este, the Duke of Ferrara in 1490.\r\n\r\nMatteo Bandello dedicated two novels to her. In 1489, Ludovico commissioned Leonardo to paint her portrait. \r\n\r\nSome call this painting, the \"first modern portrait\""},{"Id":11,"Order":5,"Header":"1485","Caption":"Portrait of a Musician","ImageUrl":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Portrait_of_a_Musician.jpg","Body":"Leonardo's only known portrait of a man.

He chooses Santa Maria delle Grazie, a small church at the heart of Milan to be a holy mausoleum for himself and his family. This church was reconstructed by Donato Bramante, Leonardo's friend. This painting was for the north wall to the new dining hall, or refectory of the church.\r\n\r\nLeonardo was procrastinating a lot to draw this and to him it allows ideas to marinate. But the duke began to get impatient. Especially when his wife, Beatrice, died in early 1497 and was buried in that church (Santa Maria delle Grazie) and the duke started dining once a week in its refectory.\r\n\r\nThis painting depicts the reactions just after Jesus tells his assembled apostles, \"One of you will betray me\".\r\n\r\nHe had to use accelerated perspective, to make the vantage point to be closer. Accelerated perspective: The walls and ceiling recede toward the vanishing point more quickly than normal. He learned this trick from the theatrical events.\r\n\r\nThe painting finished in 1498, and he got rewarded with a bonus of a vineyard near the church.\r\n\r\nHe experimented with the paint on the painting which was a failure as it started fading away soon. After 20 year the paint started to flake. When in 1550 Vasari published a biography of him and mentioned that the painting was \"ruined\". By 1652, it was so faint that the monks built a door at the bottom of the painting.\r\n\r\nThere were 6 major attempts to restore the painting. During the French Revolution, the eyes of the apostles were scratched out by anticlerical forces, and the refectory was used as a prison. During the WWII, Allied bombs hit the refectory, but the painting was protected by sandbags.\r\n\r\nDimensions: 15 feet high, 29 feet wide\r\n"}]}
